# Project Description
Working example of using React with TypeScript, i18 (localization), TanStack and testing using jest ane cypress. We also have a toggle for light and dark mode.
There will be a url input on the dashboard to run an accessibility audit on any url. That displays any issues below the input dynamically. 
We'll we using JSON WebServer to mock a DB to utilize our TanStack libraries for various examples. This whole application when complete will have WCAG 2.2 AAA as it's standard. Deployed to vercerl when fully complete to have a working demo for helping others learn about web accessibility.

Project has a 100% fully accessible baseline, and accessibility issues will be fixed with each iteration for new features.

## Variation of this demo using a supabase backend
Here is a live demo using supabase as the backend and I love Silicon Valley so it made sense to keep it simple. 
This demo also has the code available, feel free to use it by making a copy and trying it out. 
You just need to follow the steps on how to do this with the backend REDME and should be good to go.
